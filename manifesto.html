                    <p>The planet is dying. Not slowly. Not gradually. It is being murdered by corporate greed disguised
                        as environmental responsibility. While forests burn, oceans acidify, and species vanish forever,
                        corporations spend billions convincing the world they care.</p>
                    <p>They don't care. They care about profit. They care about shareholders. They care about the
                        illusion of sustainability because it increases market share and stock prices.</p>

                    <p>Traditional activism failed. Petitions achieve nothing. Protests are ignored. Legal channels move
                        too slowly while the Amazon burns. The system was designed to protect corporate power, not the
                        environment.</p>

                            planet, but they need to know. Consumers deserve to make informed choices. We provide the

                            irrefutable evidence: internal documents, financial records, video footage, communications,
                            and data. Our accusations aren't theories - they are facts proven by the corporations' own

                            destruction, we take digital action. We disrupt operations. We interrupt their ability to

                            shields. We make them personally accountable. We expose their names, their decisions, and
                            their knowledge of environmental destruction.</p>

                            information. Yes, we disrupt operations. We do this because it works. Because nothing else

                            Commission a sustainability report highlighting minor improvements while hiding major
                            destruction. Spend €100,000 on solar panels for one building while dumping millions in toxic
                            waste elsewhere.

                            Launch a marketing campaign emphasizing these token gestures. Show trees, clean water, happy
                            animals. Never show the factories, the pollution, the devastation.

                            purchased from organizations created by the corporations themselves.

                <div class="manifesto-text">
                    <p>Some question our methods. We understand. Accessing corporate systems without permission violates
                        laws written to protect corporate interests. But those same corporations violate environmental
                        laws daily with minimal consequences.</p>

                        The Asymmetry of Justice</h4>
                    <p>When a corporation dumps toxic waste, they pay a fine that represents 0.3% of quarterly profits.
                        When we expose their crimes by accessing their own documentation, we face years in prison. This
                        isn't justice - it's protection of power. We choose effectiveness over legality. History judges
                        movements by their outcomes, not their compliance with unjust laws. The suffragettes were
                        criminals. Civil rights activists were criminals. Because the laws protected injustice.</p>

                        <p class="manifesto-quote-text">"When legality protects ecocide, morality demands we act outside

                        Digital Action Works</h4>
                    <p>Traditional methods failed for decades. We've achieved more change in 18 months than traditional
                        environmental groups achieved in 18 years with the same targets.</p>
                    <p>Our exposures of NorthStar Industries led to criminal charges, €127 million in cancelled
                        contracts, and actual environmental remediation. No petition ever achieved that. Our disruption
                        of GreenWave Energy forced regulatory action that environmental lawyers couldn't achieve in six
                        years of litigation.</p>
                    <p>We don't celebrate breaking into systems. We celebrate exposing crimes. We celebrate protecting
